1. Power-Ups
	-platform size up
	-platform size down(does the size contribute to the maximum angle at which the ball can be bounced off of platform)
	-Explodey balls(ball explodes on block impact)
	-Multiply Balls
	-Destroy all balls except the first one
	-Platform instead of snapping to mouse, tries to follow it, so when the player makes a quick move left, the platform accelerates to it, not snapping

2. Things that change when mouse is used as input device
	-Platform Speed Up and Down PowerUps CANNOT spawn
	-Platform following mouse powerUp Can spawn
	
3.How the player chooses the device
	-I can use a menu, but what else would be in there?
	-A simple scene with two buttons, Mouse and Keyboard. Based on the button clicked the game loads a scene. The mouse input scene is the same as keyboard but with slightly changed scripts and UI.

4.Add visual effects for ball/platform when some powerUp is active, for example add wind like particles for sped up ball
